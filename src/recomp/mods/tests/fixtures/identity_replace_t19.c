/* identity_replace_t19.c - the replacement Gate R is exercised with.
 *
 * A replace hook that does nothing but delegate. It stands in for a native
 * replacement without being one, which is the point: whatever Gate R detects
 * when this mod is loaded is the harness's own effect, because an identity
 * replacement cannot change what the game computes. If the gate can pass with
 * a real replacement installed but not with this one, the gate is measuring
 * itself.
 *
 * call_original performs the guest RET, so this hook must not call
 * hook_return; see mods/examples/constant/constant.c for the same rule.
 *
 * The hit counter is the gate's evidence that the hook ran at all. A gate that
 * compared two identical runs would pass just as well with the mod disabled,
 * and would then be testing nothing.
