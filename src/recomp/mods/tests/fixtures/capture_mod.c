/* capture_mod.c - the isolation-mode capture, as a mod.
 *
 * A wrap hook on the candidate: snapshot pop_cpu_v1 at entry, arm page
 * tracking and shim capture, delegate to the original, snapshot again at exit,
 * and write the corpus with the pages the call touched and the shim calls it
 * made. One capture per run, of the first invocation, because the first is the
 * only one whose entry state was not shaped by the captures before it.
 *
 * FAILS CLOSED. Every reason not to trust a capture ends the same way: no file
 * is written. No target configured, tracking refuses to arm, a side-effecting
 * shim call, more pages or calls than the bound allows, a short write - each
 * one leaves the run without a corpus rather than with a corpus that would
 * certify a native replacement on evidence nobody checked.
 *
 * WHAT THE PAGE SET INCLUDES. While the window is open the whole arena is
 * inaccessible, so a guest-memory access by any thread faults and is recorded.
 * The cooperative scheduler keeps other guest threads parked, but a host
 * thread reading guest memory during the call would add its pages to the set.
 * That direction is safe: an extra page is compared and matches, or the
 * capture goes over its bound and is rejected. The unsafe direction, a missed
 * page, cannot happen while the arena is inaccessible.
 *
 * Configuration, all through the environment so no rebuild is needed:
 *   POPM_CAPTURE_TARGET  entry symbol name, or an address as 0x...
 *   POPM_CAPTURE_OUT     where to write the corpus
 *   POPM_CAPTURE_PAGES   page bound (default 4096)
 *   POPM_CAPTURE_CALLS   shim call bound (default 10000)
 *   POPM_CAPTURE_LIVE_FLAGS
 *       Which of CF,ZF,SF,OF,PF,AF replay may compare, as a bit mask in that
 *       order. The default is 0 and that is not laziness: pop_mod_api.h:55-60
 *       says those six are kept only where the translator's liveness analysis
 *       found a later read, so a hook cannot know which of them are fresh.
 *       Comparing a stale flag fails a correct replacement. Raise this only
 *       for a function whose flag liveness someone has read and written down.
