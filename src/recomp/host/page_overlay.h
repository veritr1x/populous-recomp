// WHY THIS EXISTS RATHER THAN THREE COPIES OF IT. Every presenter is handed a
// pointer to the guest's own DirectDraw surface. Drawing the page there would
// corrupt pixels the game is still reading and would change what the guest
// itself sees - a mod's overlay would become part of the simulation's input.
// So the page is drawn on a copy, and the presenter converts the copy.
//
// Three hosts present frames (headless, smoke, windowed) and all three have
// the same obligation, so the rule lives in one place where it can be tested
// once instead of being restated three times and drifting.

// consumes F10 unconditionally and every key while it is open, so registering
