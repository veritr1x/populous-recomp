# POP_RECOMP_PIN_CLOCK replaces the millisecond clock the guest reads with a
# counter that moves one step per presented frame. The claim is that two runs
# of one script then ask QMixer for very nearly the same sounds with the same
# arguments, which is what a comparison against the original needs.
#
# The numbers this was written against, four pinned and two unpinned runs of
# level1.script on this machine, counting QSWaveMix calls and comparing the two
# runs as multisets - the same call with the same arguments, order ignored:
#
#   pinned    3490, 3490, 3490 and 3493 calls; 0, 0 and 3 calls differed
#   unpinned  5373 and 5390 calls;           967 calls differed
#
# So the threshold below is two per cent of the calls, which is twenty times
# the worst pinned pair and a fortieth of the unpinned one. It is not zero and
# the run above is why: the scheduler runs its deadlines on a real monotonic
# clock by design - see kernel32.cpp sched_now, where a pinned clock would make
# every timed wait either instant or eternal - so which guest thread holds the
# baton still moves a little between runs.
#
# Two other things this comparison had to learn. The trace stamps every line
# with a real millisecond clock of its own (qmixer.cpp qm_trace_ms), so the
# lines are compared without it, by matching the call text only. And a pinned
# run and an unpinned one are not comparable to each other at all: the script's
# waits are in the same pinned milliseconds, so a pinned run covers less guest
# time and makes fewer calls. Only pinned against pinned means anything.
