/* intrinsics.h - runtime intrinsics the translator substitutes for guest
 * functions by address (the intrinsic override map).
 *
 * Included by generated C, so this header stays C-compatible.
 *
 * Currently: the MSVC CRT's _setjmp/_longjmp pair (_longjmp is 0x0055db78).
 * Both are cdecl, so each intrinsic emulates the guest RET by popping only the
 * return address; the caller cleans up the arguments.
 *
 * There are two ways to substitute _setjmp, and the two-call form is the
 * correct one:
 *
 *   1. Two-call (preferred). The translator emits the host setjmp at the call
 *      site, inside the generated function whose frame the guest will return
 *      into:
 *
 *          { jmp_buf *b = recomp_setjmp_prepare(c);
 *            recomp_setjmp_return(c, setjmp(*b)); }
 *
 *      The host jmp_buf then belongs to a frame that is still live when
 *      _longjmp fires, which is what the C standard requires.
 *
 *   2. `recomp_setjmp(c)` exists only to catch a call site that was not
 *      translated into form 1. It cannot work: the host setjmp would belong to
 *      a frame that has returned by the time _longjmp fires. It logs what the
 *      call site should emit and aborts.
