// The allowlist. Every entry is a seam whose whole observable effect is its
// return value: it reads a clock or a status word and touches nothing else.
// Deliberately short. A seam belongs here only once someone has read its
// implementation and can say it writes no file, queues no sound, consumes no
// input, allocates nothing, and changes no shim state.
//
// Time queries are not deterministic, which is fine: replay feeds back the
// value that was recorded, so the candidate sees exactly what the original
// saw. Non-determinism would only matter if we compared two live runs, and we
// do not.
//
// Every entry takes no arguments and returns everything it produces in EAX.
// That is not a coincidence and it is the second condition for the list. A
// seam that reports its answer through a caller-supplied pointer, such as
// QueryPerformanceCounter, cannot be replayed from a recorded scalar: replay
// would hand back the return value and leave the buffer unwritten, so the page
// comparison would fail for a reason that has nothing to do with the
// candidate. Such a seam is kept off the list rather than allowed to produce a
// misleading failure.
