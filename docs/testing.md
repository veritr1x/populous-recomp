# Testing

Run checks appropriate to your change. Every suite's output belongs under ignored
`build/`; requested tests must report failure rather than silently skip prerequisites.

| Command | What it checks | Needs game files? |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `tools/test.py` | Setup failures, synthetic texture processing and display-mode tooling | No |
| `tools/format.py` | Consistent formatting of handwritten native code | No |
| `tools/test.py --compile-only` | macOS host, runtime and graphics test binaries compile | No |
| `tools/test.py --native` | Runtime, graphics/audio adapters, offscreen Metal and UI tests | Yes |
| `tools/test.py --mods` | Real loader/hooks/settings/native Options and replay contracts | Yes, plus translated archive |
| `tools/test.py --gameplay` | Menu navigation, mode cycling, selection, movement and clean exit | Yes, plus translated archive |

Invoke these with `.venv/bin/python`. The native tests need a macOS Metal device;
CI compiles them but does not claim GPU or original-game execution. The mod suite
first builds and runs a deterministic 32-frame entity capture from your own game
in an isolated directory; no saved capture from another checkout is needed. The gameplay
runner uses an isolated profile and original textures unless a local pack exists.

For instruction-translation changes, use the original differential harness:

```sh
.venv/bin/python tools/recomp/tests/test_translate.py --help
.venv/bin/python tools/recomp/tests/test_translate.py
.venv/bin/python -m pytest tools/recomp/tests/test_translate_hooks.py
```

The differential harness compares translated routines with original instructions
under Unicorn. Unicorn is a development tool, not part of the playable app.

## Manual gameplay checks

- Start a level, select a person, issue a move order and observe the destination.
- Compare Classic/Enhanced and Wide on/off in a window wider than an 800×600 canvas.
- Cycle resolution through 640×480, 800×600 and 3840×2160, then resume play.
- Change graphics/host settings, quit normally, relaunch and check persistence.
- Test Command-Q, focus loss/return and mouse motion at all four edges in each window mode.
- Play the intro long enough to expose streaming stalls; check music and effects in a level.
- Compare animation speed at 60 and 120 FPS. Capture frame-pacing data during real play.

Report macOS/device, selected resolution, window mode, rendering mode and frame
limit. State whether FPS counts submitted, completed or displayed frames. A pinned
smoke clock is deterministic test timing and cannot substantiate real-time performance.

## Current local evidence

The source snapshot includes fixes exercised through native Options, live
640×480 → 800×600 → 4K → 640×480 transitions, unit movement and clean exit.
The initial publication additionally runs the source-only CI checks and local
native suites from the standalone checkout. Long campaign completion, multiplayer
and sustained 4K120 remain unverified; publish measurements with their conditions.
